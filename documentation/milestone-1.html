      <h2>Purpose, Audience and Goal</h2>
      <div class="purpose">
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project is to showcase my web development abilities and to help the family business
          gain more traction online.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="audience">
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
          The primary target audience of this website will be new and returning customers who are in need of plumbing
          services who are located in the Silver City area of southern New Mexico. These customers will vary widely
          as plumbing and HVAC services are something that everyone is in need of at one point or another. The
          business offers a wide variety of services from smaller things like leaky faucets to full remodels, water
          heater installations or HVAC system installation and service. The business can also assist with utility
          issues such as water mains, sewer mains, gas service lines, and an occasional septic system. Additional
          clients that may be attracted to the business would be commercial clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          The secondary audience I would like to reach would be potential employers or internships, or even possible
          freelance clientele. I would like to provide this website as a good example of my skills and the hard work
          that I put into every project I take on.

      <div class="goal">
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
          There are two primary objectives I would like to achieve with this project:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cultivating my skills and experience in developing different projects for my
            portfolio</strong></li>
          <p>
            I would like to work on several different projects and different types of projects to get as much
            practice using front end and back end development skills as I'm able to. I would like to add this
            project to my professional portfolio once this bootcamp comes to a close as a central piece of work
            since it will be completely designed and programmed by me, and me, alone. I think this will be a
            great way to get in practice for the entire process of beginning a new project as well as practicing
            the skills I have learned thus far in this bootcamp.
          </p>
          <li><strong>Assisting that family business that my grandparents started decades ago to gain an
            online presence and provide additional information for potential customers</strong></li>
          <p>
            During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became very clear that small businesses that do not have an online
            presence are at a significant disadvantage over other competitors who <em>do</em> have an online
            presence. I feel very passionate about giving these small or local businesses a fighting chance to be
            seen by a wider audience and I would like to eventually start my own small business offering this
            service. Because of that, I wanted to start with a business that I know doesn't have any kind of
            online presence outside a Facebook page that is rarely updated if ever. I would like to help my
            family gain more visibility even if they are fairly well known locally. In addition to helping expand
            their customer base, I would also like to save them valuable time by helping customers get the
            answers to frequently asked questions without having to contact the business via phone to do so.
