<h1>Milestone Two</h1>
<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
<section>
  <h3>Header</h3>
  <p>
    The header will contain the logo and name of the business on the left of the uppermost banner. The navigation bar
    will overlap with the banner and the hero image to provide a two-dimensional feel to the website. On the bottom
    of the hero image will be 4 containers that contain quick and easy access to what the business is about -
    primarily plumbing, hvac, and utility services with an image accompanying the description. These containers will
    also overlap with the hero image.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>
    This section will focus on information about the business with a focus on being a family owned and operated small
    business. This section will also contain information about how long they have been in business and servicing the
    area, some information about their mission, as well as an image meant to draw users in, either of the business,
    work they have done, or the current owner. It may also contain an excerpt from a magazine article the business
    was featured in or a photo from the same source.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Our Services</h3>
  <p>
    This section will consist of six images that show or describe the main services the company is hired for most
    often, as well as custom services that are only offered by the company. Initially, I would like to have the image
    dimmed to allow the text of the service name to be more of a focus and more readable. When a user hovers over it,
    the text will dim or be removed completely and the image will no longer be dimmed. Additionally, a flyout text box
    will appear beneath the image to provide more detailed information about that service.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Testimonials</h3>
  <p>
    The testimonial section will contain business reviews from real customers that are pulled from Google reviews and
    contain a review title, reviewer name, a check mark icon if the review is verified, a star rating, image if one
    is available, and the content of the review. Each review will be in a container that behaves like a slideshow to
    allow users to focus on one review at a time instead of having so many things to read on the page. This will draw
    their focus and not overwhelm users.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Contact Us</h3>
  <p>
    This section will contain a simple contact form. On the left side will be a standard form to fill out name,
    email, phone number and a message. Underneath the text box for the message is a checkbox that users can check if
    they are in need of emergency services. I plan to include a modal that will pop up when that box is checked to
    advise the user that the best way to contact the business for immediate service is to contact them by phone or
    stop into the office. On the right side of the contact sections will be a image or link to Google maps to find
    the location of the office. Below that is a listing of the business name, location, phone number, and email address.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Footer</h3>
  <p>
    Because this is a simple one page website, there's not a need for an elaborate site map in the footer, which is
    why I plan to keep it simple. The links provided in the footer will be the same links that are available in the
    top navigation bar for easy access back to the top or a specific section. The only other link that will be
    provided is a link to the Facebook page on the right corner of the footer. On the left corner of the footer will
    be an image of the company logo to enhance branding.

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
